## Key Findings Summary

### Architecture
- **30+ Rust crates** in workspace with clean layered design
- **Library-first**: All functionality available as libraries, not just CLI
- **No circular dependencies**: Clean dependency flow
- **Data-driven**: YAML configuration, no hardcoding

### Multi-Protocol Support
- HTTP/REST (OpenAPI)
- WebSocket
- gRPC
- GraphQL
- MQTT, Kafka, AMQP
- SMTP, FTP

### Mock Features
- Latency injection (multiple profiles)
- Failure/chaos injection
- Template engine ({{uuid}}, {{faker.name}}, etc.)
- AI-powered response generation
- Request chaining (multi-step workflows)
- Workspace management with environments
- Request recording (Flight Recorder)

### Configuration
- YAML files
- Programmatic API (Rust structs)
- Environment variable overrides
- Named profiles (dev, ci, prod)
- Per-route validation and response settings

### Existing SDKs
- Go SDK (plugin system, TinyGo + WASM)
- Python SDK (remote plugins, FastAPI-based)
- More can be created following the same pattern
