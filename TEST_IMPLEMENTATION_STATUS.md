# MockForge Test Implementation Status

This document outlines the current state of automated tests in MockForge, including what's implemented, what's partially implemented with warnings, and what's not yet implemented.

## ‚úÖ Fully Implemented and Tested

### Core Infrastructure
- **Installation & Setup**: Build from source, local installation, basic configuration validation
- **HTTP/REST Server**: Basic server startup, health endpoints, OpenAPI documentation generation
- **WebSocket Server**: Server startup, basic connectivity
- **gRPC Server**: Server startup, basic service discovery
- **SMTP Email Testing**: Server startup with SMTP port
- **Data Generation**: Built-in templates (user, product, order), JSON/CSV/JSONL output formats, custom schema generation (basic structure)
- **CLI Commands**: Basic command validation, help system, version checking
- **Docker Testing**: Image building, container startup, basic networking, volume mounts (basic)

### Working Features
- **Failure Injection**: Chaos engineering failure injection works correctly
- **RAG Integration**: Environment variables for RAG providers (OpenAI, Ollama) are supported
- **Environment Variables**: Comprehensive environment variable support for configuration
- **Basic Routing**: HTTP routing and response handling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented (Working with Limitations)

### Data Generation
- **Custom Schema Generation**: Creates data structure with partial constraint enforcement
  - ‚úÖ Basic type validation (string, number, boolean, etc.)
  - ‚úÖ Min/max constraints for numbers and strings
  - ‚úÖ Format extraction (email, URL) from schema
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Type flexibility: integer/number types are interchangeable
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Format validation: implemented but may not be strictly enforced
  - Workaround: Use for structured data generation with basic constraints

### Environment Variables
- **Comprehensive Support**: Most environment variables are implemented and tested
  - ‚úÖ Feature flags: `MOCKFORGE_LATENCY_ENABLED`, `MOCKFORGE_FAILURES_ENABLED`, `MOCKFORGE_TRAFFIC_SHAPING_ENABLED`, `MOCKFORGE_LOG_LEVEL`
  - ‚úÖ External services: `MOCKFORGE_RAG_API_KEY`, `MOCKFORGE_WS_REPLAY_FILE`, `MOCKFORGE_GRPC_HTTP_BRIDGE_ENABLED`
  - ‚úÖ Advanced features: `MOCKFORGE_RESPONSE_TEMPLATE_EXPAND`, `MOCKFORGE_REQUEST_VALIDATION`
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Port configuration: Environment variables accepted but overridden by CLI defaults (bug)
    - Issue: CLI always applies default values even when env vars are set
    - Workaround: Use CLI flags (`--http-port`, `--admin-port`) or config files for port configuration

### Docker Features
- **Basic Deployment**: Core Docker functionality works
  - Issue: Environment variable overrides in containers may not work
  - Issue: Advanced networking features not fully tested
  - Workaround: Use config files for container configuration

### Admin UI
- **Basic Web Interface**: Serves on configured admin port
  - Issue: Limited functionality, no interactive features
  - Issue: Advanced management features not implemented
  - Workaround: Use CLI and config files for management

## üß™ Test Coverage Strategy

### Current Approach
- **Implemented Features**: Full automated testing with assertions
- **Partially Implemented**: Tests run but with clear warnings about limitations
- **Not Implemented**: Tests skip with informative messages about future availability

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Core library functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Server startup, basic connectivity
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full workflow testing (limited due to external dependencies)
- **Manual Tests**: Complex scenarios requiring external tools or services

### External Dependencies
Some tests require external tools/services that may not be available:
- **grpcurl**: For advanced gRPC testing
- **websocat**: For WebSocket protocol testing
- **Ollama/OpenAI**: For RAG-powered generation
- **SMTP clients**: For email testing
- **Docker**: For container deployment testing

## ü§ù Contributing

When implementing new features:

1. **Add appropriate tests** for fully implemented features
2. **Use warning messages** for partially implemented features with clear limitations
3. **Skip tests** for unimplemented features with roadmap information
4. **Update this document** when implementation status changes
5. **Consider manual testing** for complex features requiring external dependencies

## üìä Test Execution Summary

```bash
# Run all automated tests
./scripts/run-automated-tests.sh

# Run individual test suites
./scripts/automated-tests/test-installation.sh
./scripts/automated-tests/test-http.sh
./scripts/automated-tests/test-data-generation.sh
# ... etc
```

### Expected Test Results
- **Passing Tests**: Core functionality verification
- **Warning Tests**: Known limitations clearly documented
- **Skipped Tests**: Future features with implementation roadmap
