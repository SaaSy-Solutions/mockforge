# Active Context: Plugin System Implementation

## Current Focus
Implementing a comprehensive plugin system to enable user-created plugins for authentication, template tags, response generators, and data sources. This represents a major architectural enhancement that will make MockForge truly extensible.

## Recent Accomplishments
âœ… **Import Functionality**: All import formats (Postman, Insomnia, Curl) fully implemented
âœ… **Authentication System**: Complete JWT, OAuth2, Basic Auth, and API Key support
âœ… **Template System**: Extensive token expansion with faker providers and encryption
âœ… **Response Generators**: MockGenerator trait interface for custom responses

## Immediate Next Steps
âœ… **Plugin Architecture Design**: COMPLETED - WebAssembly-based plugin system designed
âœ… **Plugin Types Implementation**: COMPLETED - AuthPlugin, TemplatePlugin, ResponsePlugin, DataSourcePlugin traits implemented
âœ… **Plugin Loader Implementation**: COMPLETED - Security sandboxing, validation, and lifecycle management
âœ… **Plugin Registry System**: COMPLETED - Discovery, dependency resolution, and hot-reload
âœ… **CLI Integration**: Complete plugin management command suite implemented
âœ… **Example Plugins**: Complete implementations for all four plugin types
âœ… **Admin UI Integration**: Full plugin management interface in admin dashboard
âœ… **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete plugin development guides and API reference
âœ… **Test Suite**: Full test coverage for plugin functionality and security
âœ… **Advanced Security Measures**: Dependency validation, plugin signing, and sophisticated WASM analysis
ðŸš€ **PRODUCTION READY**: Complete enterprise-grade plugin ecosystem ready for deployment

## Technical Context
- **Architecture**: WASM-based plugin system with Rust development workflow
- **Security Model**: Sandboxed execution with capability-based permissions
- **Plugin Types**: Four main categories (Auth, Template, Response, Data Source)
- **Integration Points**: Extend existing authentication middleware, templating engine, and response generation
- **Distribution**: Plugin marketplace/registry with CLI and UI management

## Key Implementation Details
- WebAssembly runtime using `wasmtime` for secure plugin execution
- Plugin manifest system with metadata, capabilities, and dependencies
- Hot-reload capabilities for development workflow
- Comprehensive security measures (memory limits, network isolation, code signing)
- CLI commands for plugin management (install, list, remove, update)
- UI integration in admin interface for plugin marketplace

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing features
- Security is paramount - plugins run in sandboxed environment
- Performance impact must be minimal (<100ms startup, <10ms execution)
- Plugin ecosystem needs to scale to hundreds of plugins
- Development experience should be seamless for Rust developers

## Success Criteria for Plugin System
- **Security**: Zero security incidents, comprehensive sandboxing
- **Performance**: <100ms plugin loading, <10ms average execution
- **Usability**: Intuitive CLI/UI for plugin management
- **Ecosystem**: SDK, documentation, and example plugins available
- **Adoption**: 10+ official plugins, community plugin support
