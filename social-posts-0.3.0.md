🚀 **MockForge 0.3.0 is here** — and it's a game-changer for API mocking.

We've moved beyond "random-but-consistent fake data" to **coherent world simulation**. Here's what's new:

**🎭 Smart Personas v2**
Persona graphs that maintain relationships across entities. Your mock users, orders, and payments stay consistent across endpoints. Plus, lifecycle states (NewSignup → Active → ChurnRisk) that influence responses everywhere. Fidelity scores quantify how real your mock environment is.

**📊 Drift Budget & GitOps**
Your mock server is now the drift nerve center. Define acceptable contract drift, get alerts when budgets are exceeded, and automatically generate PRs to update contracts and fixtures. Breaking changes caught before they break your tests.

**🎬 Behavioral Cloning v1**
Record real multi-step flows from production systems and replay them as named scenarios. Move from endpoint-level mocks to journey-level simulations. Test entire user journeys, not just individual API calls.

**🎤 LLM/Voice Interface**
Describe your system in natural language → MockForge builds a complete mock backend with personas, behaviors, and reality config. No manual configuration. Just describe what you need.

**✅ Production-Ready**
76 integration tests covering every feature. 100% pass rate. This isn't a prototype—it's production-ready.

The future of API mocking isn't just about mocking endpoints. It's about simulating entire systems.

🎉 **MockForge 0.3.0 is live!**

We just shipped the biggest release yet, and it's all about making mocks feel real.

**What's new:**

✨ **Smart Personas v2** — Persona graphs that keep your mock data consistent across all endpoints. Users, orders, payments—everything stays connected. Plus lifecycle states that make your mocks evolve like real users.

🛡️ **Drift Budget & GitOps** — Never let API contracts drift too far. Set budgets, get alerts, and automatically generate PRs to fix things. Breaking changes caught early.

🎬 **Behavioral Cloning** — Record real flows from production and replay them as test scenarios. Test entire user journeys, not just single API calls.

🎤 **LLM/Voice Interface** — Just describe your system in plain English, and MockForge builds the whole mock backend for you. No configuration files. No manual setup. Just describe and go.

✅ **76 integration tests** — Everything is tested and production-ready.

If you're building APIs or testing against them, this release is worth checking out.
