# Cargo configuration for MockForge
# This file helps with sqlx offline mode for mockforge-collab

[env]
# Set DATABASE_URL for sqlx compile-time query checking
# Using SQLite for development - can be overridden with environment variable
# Note: The database file will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
DATABASE_URL = { value = "sqlite:///home/rclanan/dev/projects/work/mockforge/crates/mockforge-collab/compile-check.db" }

# Enable sqlx offline mode to avoid database connection requirements during compilation
# Set this to true if you don't have a database connection available
# SQLX_OFFLINE = "true"
# Note: Disabled for now - using DATABASE_URL instead for compile-time checking

# Note: If you need to update sqlx query metadata, run:
# cd crates/mockforge-collab && cargo sqlx prepare --database-url postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname
