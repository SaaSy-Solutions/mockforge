# Cargo configuration for MockForge
# This file helps with sqlx offline mode for mockforge-collab
#
# IMPORTANT FOR PUBLISHING:
# - Published crates from crates.io will include the .sqlx/ directory
# - The build.rs script automatically enables SQLX_OFFLINE=true when .sqlx exists
# - No DATABASE_URL is needed for published crates
# - This config is only for local development when regenerating query cache

[env]
# DATABASE_URL for local development only (commented out for publishing)
# Uncomment this line only when you need to regenerate .sqlx query cache locally
# DATABASE_URL = { value = "sqlite:///home/rclanan/dev/projects/work/mockforge/crates/mockforge-collab/compile-check.db" }

# Enable sqlx offline mode to avoid database connection requirements during compilation
# The build.rs script automatically enables this when .sqlx directory exists
# SQLX_OFFLINE = "true"

# Note: If you need to update sqlx query metadata, run:
# cd crates/mockforge-collab && cargo sqlx prepare --database-url postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname
