# MockForge Issues Fixed - Real-World Usage Feedback

This document summarizes fixes applied based on real-world usage feedback from Apiary Pro frontend development.

## ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Docker Build Failures

**Issue:** Dockerfile build failed due to workspace member references and missing build tools.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Improved `sed` patterns in Dockerfile to robustly remove `test_openapi_demo` and `tests` workspace members
- ✅ Added `|| true` to sed commands to prevent build failures if patterns don't match
- ✅ Verified C++ build tools (build-essential, g++, cmake) are already installed in Dockerfile
- ✅ Added `DOCKER_CONTAINER=true` environment variable for Docker environment detection

**Files Changed:**
- `Dockerfile`: Lines 22-26, 76-78

**Impact:** Docker builds should now work reliably without manual intervention.

---

### 2. Admin UI Not Accessible

**Issue:** Admin UI bound to `127.0.0.1` by default, making it inaccessible from outside Docker containers.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Admin UI now uses `config.admin.host` instead of hardcoded `127.0.0.1`
- ✅ Added `MOCKFORGE_ADMIN_HOST` environment variable support in `apply_env_overrides()`
- ✅ Auto-detection of Docker environment in `AdminConfig::default()`:
  - Checks for `DOCKER_CONTAINER` env var
  - Checks for `container` env var  
  - Checks for `/.dockerenv` file existence
  - Defaults to `0.0.0.0` in Docker, `127.0.0.1` otherwise
- ✅ Set `MOCKFORGE_ADMIN_HOST=0.0.0.0` in Dockerfile defaults
- ✅ Improved error messages when Admin UI binding fails
- ✅ Admin UI startup message now shows correct host and port

**Files Changed:**
- `crates/mockforge-core/src/config.rs`: Lines 723-747, 1218-1221
- `crates/mockforge-cli/src/main.rs`: Lines 2992-3022
- `Dockerfile`: Lines 76-78

**Impact:** Admin UI is now accessible from outside Docker containers by default, with clear configuration options.

### 3. OpenAPI Examples Not Used

**Issue:** Users reported that OpenAPI `example` values weren't being used for response generation.

**Investigation Results:**
- ✅ Verified that OpenAPI example support is **already implemented correctly**
- ✅ Code in `crates/mockforge-core/src/openapi/response.rs` checks for examples in this order:
  1. `media_type.example` (single example)
  2. `media_type.examples` map (multiple examples with scenarios)
  3. Schema-based generation (fallback)

**Possible Causes:**
- OpenAPI spec may not have examples in the correct format
- Examples may be in a different media type than requested
- Schema-based generation may be preferred in some cases

**Recommendation:** If examples still aren't working, verify:
1. Examples are in the `application/json` media type (or the content type being requested)
2. Examples are at the response level: `responses.200.content.application/json.example`
3. Examples match the schema type

**Files Reviewed:**
- `crates/mockforge-core/src/openapi/response.rs`: Lines 274-320

**Impact:** Examples are used when present. If issues persist, they may be due to spec formatting rather than code issues.

## ✅ High Priority Issues Fixed

### 4. Config File Validation - Improved Error Messages

**Issue:** Config validation error messages were cryptic and didn't show full field paths.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Enhanced error message formatting with field path extraction
- ✅ Added helpful suggestions based on error type (missing field, unknown field, type mismatch)
- ✅ Clarified that most fields are optional with defaults
- ✅ Improved YAML and JSON error formatters to show:
  - Full field paths (e.g., `http.host` instead of just `host`)
  - Line and column numbers with context
  - Actionable tips for fixing common errors
  - Links to `config.template.yaml` for reference
- ✅ Added field path extraction from serde error messages
- ✅ Improved error messages in `load_config()` to explain optional fields

**Files Changed:**
- `crates/mockforge-cli/src/main.rs`: Lines 4965-5163 (improved `format_yaml_error`, `format_json_error`, added `extract_field_path`)
- `crates/mockforge-core/src/config.rs`: Lines 1119-1154 (improved error messages in `load_config`)

**New Error Message Format:**
```
❌ Configuration parsing error:

📍 Location: line 5, column 3

  > 5 |   host: "0.0.0.0"
    ^

🔍 Field path: http.host
❌ Error: missing field `port`

💡 Tip: This field is usually optional and has a default value.
   Most configuration fields can be omitted - MockForge will use sensible defaults.
   
   To fix: Either add the field at path 'http.port' or remove it entirely (defaults will be used).
   See config.template.yaml for all available options and their defaults.

📚 For a complete example configuration, see: config.template.yaml
   Or run: mockforge init .
```

**Impact:** Users now get clear, actionable error messages that explain:
- Exactly which field is problematic (with full path)
- Where the error is located (line/column)
- That fields are optional and have defaults
- How to fix the issue
- Where to find more information

### 5. Protobuf Compiler Warning

**Issue:** Warning message was unclear: "Failed to compile with protoc, falling back to mock"

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Improved warning message to clarify this is expected behavior for basic usage
- ✅ Added explanation that fallback mock services are used when protoc isn't available

**Files Changed:**
- `crates/mockforge-grpc/src/dynamic/proto_parser.rs`: Lines 177-184

**New Message:**
```
protoc not available or compilation failed (this is OK for basic usage, using fallback): <error>
```

**Impact:** Users will understand this warning is harmless and expected.

### 6. Health Check Endpoint Improvements

**Issue:** Health endpoint didn't provide useful information about Admin UI, loaded specs, etc.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Added Admin UI status check with port information
- ✅ Enhanced server status checks to include actual addresses
- ✅ Improved overall status determination (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
- ✅ Better messages showing which services are running and on what addresses

**Files Changed:**
- `crates/mockforge-ui/src/handlers/health.rs`: Lines 154-261

**New Health Check Response Includes:**
- Admin UI accessibility status and port
- All server addresses (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, GraphQL)
- Service status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
- Request metrics

**Impact:** Health endpoint now provides actionable information for monitoring and debugging.

## 📋 Summary

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Docker build failures
2. ✅ Admin UI accessibility  
3. ✅ Verified OpenAPI examples support
4. ✅ Clarified protoc warnings
5. ✅ Enhanced health check endpoint

### Remaining Issues (Lower Priority):
- Config validation error messages could be more specific (fields are already optional)
- Documentation updates needed for Docker deployment
- Response generation strategy visibility (examples ARE used, but logging could be improved)
