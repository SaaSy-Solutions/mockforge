## ðŸŸ¡ Remaining Incomplete Features (Enhancements)

### 1. TypeScript/JavaScript Code Generation âœ…

**Status**: âœ… **Fully Implemented**
**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium (Enhancement, not blocker)
**Location**: `crates/mockforge-core/src/codegen/typescript_generator.rs`

**Current State**:
- âœ… Fully functional TypeScript/JavaScript code generation
- âœ… Generates Express.js-based mock servers
- âœ… Handles all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)
- âœ… Supports path parameters, query parameters, request bodies
- âœ… Generates mock responses based on OpenAPI schemas
- âœ… Supports CORS configuration
- âœ… Supports response delay simulation
- âœ… All tests passing

**Features**:
- Express.js server class with route handlers
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Path parameter extraction (`/users/:id`)
- Query parameter handling
- Request body parsing for POST/PUT/PATCH
- Schema-based mock response generation
- Configurable port, CORS, and delays

**Usage**:
```bash
mockforge generate --spec api.json --language ts
mockforge generate --spec api.json --language js
```

**Recommendation**:
- âœ… **Complete** - Feature is fully implemented and tested

### 2. Advanced gRPC Features (Future Enhancements)

**Status**: Code exists, marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` for future integration
**Priority**: ðŸ”µ Low (Future enhancements)
**Locations**:
- `crates/mockforge-grpc/src/dynamic/http_bridge/converters.rs` - Protobuf-JSON conversion
- `crates/mockforge-grpc/src/reflection/schema_graph.rs` - Relationship analysis
- `crates/mockforge-grpc/src/reflection/smart_mock_generator.rs` - Range-based generation

**Current State**:
- Code is written and documented
- Marked with TODO comments explaining integration points
- Will be integrated as features mature

**Recommendation**:
- âœ… **No action needed** - These are intentionally deferred enhancements
- Code is ready for integration when needed
- All marked with clear TODO comments

---

### 3. JavaScript Scripting Integration

**Status**: Code structure exists, integration pending
**Priority**: ðŸ”µ Low (Future enhancement)
**Location**: `crates/mockforge-core/src/request_scripting.rs`

**Current State**:
- Module structure in place
- JavaScript runtime integration (`rquickjs`) available
- Marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` and TODO comment

**Recommendation**:
- âœ… **No action needed** - Feature enhancement, not incomplete core functionality
- Code is documented and ready for integration

---

### 4. Chaos Engineering Fine-Grained Controls

**Status**: Basic chaos engineering works, fine-grained controls pending
**Priority**: ðŸ”µ Low (Enhancement)
**Location**: `crates/mockforge-cli/src/main.rs` (lines 1878-1885)

**Current State**:
- Basic chaos features functional
- Fine-grained error rate and delay controls marked as TODO
- Fields marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]`

**Recommendation**:
- âœ… **No action needed** - Enhancement feature
- Core chaos engineering works
- Fine-grained controls are nice-to-have
