  - Integrate chains with services

### 3. `performance.spec.ts` (4 test suites, ~11 tests)

**Purpose:** Tests performance metrics and optimizations.

**Coverage:**
- âœ… **Page Load Times**
  - Load dashboard within acceptable time (< 30s)
  - Load services page within acceptable time (< 15s)
  - Load all major pages within acceptable time
  - Fast navigation between pages (< 2s)
  
- âœ… **API Response Times**
  - Measure API response times
  - Handle slow API responses gracefully
  
- âœ… **Large Dataset Handling**
  - Handle large service lists
  - Handle large fixture lists
  - Handle large log entries
  - Paginate or virtualize large lists
  
- âœ… **Memory and Resource Usage**
  - No memory leaks on navigation
  - Handle rapid interactions without degradation

### 4. `coverage-monitoring.spec.ts` (1 test suite, ~4 tests)

**Purpose:** Tests to ensure code coverage collection is working.

**Coverage:**
- âœ… **Coverage Collection**
  - Collect coverage data when enabled
  - Visit all pages for comprehensive coverage
  
- âœ… **Coverage Tracking**
  - Track coverage trends
  - Validate coverage thresholds

## Test Statistics

- **Total New Test Files:** 4
- **Total New Test Suites:** 13
- **Total New Tests:** ~40 tests
- **Coverage Areas:** 4 major categories (Feature-Specific, Integration, Performance, Coverage Monitoring)

## Test Features

All new tests follow established patterns:
- âœ… Use `setupTest()` helper for consistent setup
- âœ… Use `assertPageLoaded()` for page verification
- âœ… Handle both populated and empty states gracefully
- âœ… Include timeout handling for async operations
- âœ… Test complete workflows and multi-step operations
- âœ… Measure and validate performance metrics
- âœ… Include safety measures (cancel destructive operations)

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all recommendation coverage tests
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npx playwright test \
  e2e/feature-specific.spec.ts \
  e2e/workflow-integration.spec.ts \
  e2e/performance.spec.ts \
  e2e/coverage-monitoring.spec.ts

# Run specific test suite
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npx playwright test \
  e2e/feature-specific.spec.ts --grep "Fixture CRUD"

# Run performance tests only
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npx playwright test \
  e2e/performance.spec.ts

# Run with coverage collection
COLLECT_COVERAGE=true PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npx playwright test \
  e2e/coverage-monitoring.spec.ts
```

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Page Load Times:**
  - Dashboard: < 30 seconds (including login)
  - Services: < 15 seconds
  - Other pages: < 15 seconds
  
- **Navigation:**
  - Page-to-page navigation: < 2 seconds
  
- **API Response:**
  - Average response time: < 5 seconds
  - Maximum response time: < 10 seconds

## Coverage Completeness

With these new tests, we now have comprehensive coverage for:

âœ… **All 24 pages** - Basic functionality and navigation
âœ… **Feature Interactions** - User workflows and actions
âœ… **Advanced Features** - Complex operations and integrations
âœ… **Edge Cases** - Error handling and boundary conditions
âœ… **Feature-Specific** - Actual CRUD operations and workflows
âœ… **Integration** - Multi-page workflows and state persistence
âœ… **Performance** - Load times, API response times, large datasets
âœ… **Coverage Monitoring** - Coverage collection and tracking

**Total Test Coverage:** ~240+ E2E tests across 37+ test files! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

- Performance tests include benchmarks that can be adjusted based on actual performance requirements
- Coverage monitoring tests require `COLLECT_COVERAGE=true` environment variable
- Feature-specific tests include safety measures (cancel destructive operations)
- Integration tests verify state persistence and cross-feature workflows
- All tests are designed to be resilient and handle various application states
