## Test Statistics

- **Total New Test Files:** 3
- **Total New Test Suites:** 16
- **Total New Tests:** ~40+ tests
- **Coverage Areas:** 3 major categories (Feature Interactions, Advanced Features, Edge Cases)

## Test Features

All new tests follow established patterns:
- ✅ Use `setupTest()` helper for consistent setup
- ✅ Use `assertPageLoaded()` for page verification
- ✅ Use `checkAnyVisible()` for flexible content checks
- ✅ Handle both populated and empty states gracefully
- ✅ Include timeout handling for async operations
- ✅ Test error scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ Verify UI interactions and workflows

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all gap coverage tests
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npx playwright test \
  e2e/feature-interactions.spec.ts \
  e2e/advanced-features.spec.ts \
  e2e/edge-cases.spec.ts

# Run specific test suite
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npx playwright test \
  e2e/feature-interactions.spec.ts --grep "Service Enable/Disable"

# Run all tests (including gap coverage)
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npx playwright test
```

## Coverage Completeness

With these new tests, we now have comprehensive coverage for:

✅ **All 24 pages** - Basic functionality and navigation
✅ **Feature Interactions** - User workflows and actions
✅ **Advanced Features** - Complex operations and integrations
✅ **Edge Cases** - Error handling and boundary conditions

**Total Test Coverage:** ~150+ E2E tests across 33+ test files!

## Notes

- Tests are designed to be resilient and handle both populated and empty states
- Some tests verify UI presence without performing destructive actions (e.g., deletion tests cancel)
- Network simulation tests use Playwright's route interception
- Form validation tests verify error states without submitting invalid data
- All tests include proper cleanup and state management
