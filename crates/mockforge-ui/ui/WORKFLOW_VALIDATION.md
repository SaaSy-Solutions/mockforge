- P50, P95, P99 percentile displays
- Success/failure pie charts
- HTTP status code distribution bar charts
- Service-specific metric filtering
- SLA compliance monitoring with visual indicators
- Overall system health metrics
- Auto-refreshing metrics every 30 seconds
- Performance alerts for high error rates or latency

**File Editing Eliminated**: No need to configure external monitoring tools or query metrics databases

### 7. ✅ Bulk Operations
**Workflow**: Manage multiple services and fixtures simultaneously

**Capabilities Validated**:
- "Enable All" / "Disable All" buttons for bulk service management
- Tag-based filtering for bulk operations on service groups
- Multiple fixture selection for batch operations
- Search and filter before applying bulk changes
- Visual confirmation of bulk operation results
- Undo capability for accidental bulk changes

**File Editing Eliminated**: No need to edit multiple configuration files manually

### 8. ✅ Advanced Search & Filtering
**Workflow**: Find and filter across all data types

**Capabilities Validated**:
- Service search by name, route path, and tags
- Fixture search by filename, path, and content
- Log search by method, path, status code, and message content
- Real-time filtering with immediate results
- Persistent filter state across navigation
- Clear filters functionality
- Filter count indicators

**File Editing Eliminated**: No need to grep through files or use command-line search tools

### 9. ✅ Role-Based Feature Access
**Workflow**: Appropriate feature access based on user role

**Capabilities Validated**:
- **Admin Role**: Full access to all features
  - Services: Read/write access to enable/disable services and routes
  - Fixtures: Full CRUD operations on fixture files
  - Configuration: Access to all configuration panels
  - Testing: Access to workflow validation tools
- **Viewer Role**: Read-only access
  - Dashboard: View system status and server information
  - Logs: View and filter logs (no clearing or configuration)
  - Metrics: View performance metrics and charts
  - No access to: Services, Fixtures, Configuration, Testing
- Navigation adapts to show only accessible tabs
- Graceful permission denied messages for restricted features

**File Editing Eliminated**: No need to manually configure user permissions in configuration files

### 10. ✅ Configuration Management
**Workflow**: Modify server settings through web interface

**Capabilities Validated**:
- Latency profile configuration (base latency, jitter)
- Fault injection settings (enable/disable, failure rates)
- Proxy configuration (upstream URLs, timeouts)
- Validation settings (modes, error aggregation)
- Environment variable management
- Real-time configuration updates
- Configuration backup and restore

**File Editing Eliminated**: No need to edit YAML/JSON configuration files manually

## Automated Testing Suite
