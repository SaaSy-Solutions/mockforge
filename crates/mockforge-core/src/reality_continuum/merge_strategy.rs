//! Merge strategy implementations
//!
//! This module provides extensibility for different merge strategies.
//! Currently, merge strategies are defined in config.rs, but this module
//! can be extended with additional strategy-specific logic if needed.

// Merge strategies are currently defined in config.rs as an enum.
// This module exists for future extensibility if strategy-specific
// implementations are needed.
