# Intelligent Mock Behavior - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

The **Intelligent Mock Behavior System** has been designed and implemented as a foundational framework for MockForge. This system transforms MockForge from a static mock server into an **AI-powered, stateful service simulator**.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components Created

1. **`intelligent_behavior/` Module** (`crates/mockforge-core/src/intelligent_behavior/`)
   - **mod.rs**: Module entry point with re-exports
   - **types.rs**: Core data structures (`InteractionRecord`, `SessionState`, `BehaviorRules`)
   - **config.rs**: Configuration schema for the entire system
   - **session.rs**: Session management and tracking
   - **rules.rs**: Consistency rules and state machines
   - **context.rs**: Stateful AI context manager
   - **behavior.rs**: LLM-powered behavior model
   - **memory.rs**: Vector memory store for semantic search

2. **Configuration Support**
   - Comprehensive YAML configuration schema
   - Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
   - Session tracking via cookies, headers, or query parameters
   - Performance tuning options

3. **Documentation**
   - **INTELLIGENT_MOCK_BEHAVIOR.md**: Complete design document with architecture diagrams
   - **INTELLIGENT_BEHAVIOR_GUIDE.md**: Integration guide with examples
   - **intelligent-behavior-ecommerce.yaml**: Example configuration

## Key Features

### 1. Stateful Context Management
- **Session Tracking**: Maintains state across multiple API requests
- **Interaction History**: Records all request/response pairs
- **State Snapshots**: Caches current state for fast access
- **Automatic Session Creation**: Optionally creates sessions on-the-fly

### 2. LLM-Powered Decision Making
- **Intelligent Response Generation**: Uses AI to create context-aware responses
- **Prompt Engineering**: Builds comprehensive prompts from request context and history
- **Schema-Aware**: Generates data conforming to JSON schemas
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or compatible APIs

### 3. Consistency Rules
- **Authentication Requirements**: Enforce login before accessing protected resources
- **Resource Ownership**: Users can only access their own data
- **Business Logic**: Custom rules for domain-specific constraints
- **Priority-Based Evaluation**: Higher priority rules execute first

### 4. State Machines
- **Resource Lifecycle**: Define realistic state transitions (e.g., order status)
- **Probabilistic Transitions**: Configurable probabilities for each transition
- **Side Effects**: Trigger actions when state changes
- **Validation**: Prevent invalid state transitions

### 5. Vector Memory Store
- **Long-Term Memory**: Persist interactions beyond session lifetime
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant past interactions by meaning
- **Embedding Generation**: Create vector representations of interactions
- **Configurable Storage**: In-memory or persistent storage options

## What Makes This Unique

### Industry-First Features

1. **LLM-Powered Stateful Mocking**
   - No other mock server uses AI to maintain consistency across requests
   - Goes beyond static responses to simulate a "thinking" backend

2. **Conversation-Like API Simulation**
   - Treats API interactions as a conversation
   - Remembers context and makes intelligent decisions

3. **Natural Language Configuration**
   - Define behavior rules in plain English
   - No complex scripts or programming required

4. **Semantic Memory**
   - Uses vector embeddings to find relevant past context
   - More sophisticated than simple history lookup

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. E-commerce Workflow Testing
```
Login → Add to Cart → View Cart → Checkout → Track Order
```
- Cart items persist across requests
- Orders consume cart items
- Stock quantities update realistically
- Order status progresses naturally

### 2. Social Media API Simulation
```
Create Post → Follow User → View Feed → Like Post → Comment
```
- Feed shows posts from followed users only
- Cannot like your own posts
- Relationship tracking (followers/following)

### 3. Multi-Step Business Processes
```
Submit Application → Upload Documents → Review → Approve/Reject
```
- Each step depends on previous completion
- Documents are remembered and retrieved later
- Status transitions follow business rules

### Integration Points

1. **With Existing Chain Execution**
   - Extends `ChainExecutionContext` with AI context
   - Allows chains to leverage intelligent behavior

2. **With RAG Engine**
   - Uses existing `mockforge-data` RAG capabilities
   - Reuses LLM provider infrastructure

3. **With OpenAPI Routes**
   - Can enhance OpenAPI-based mocks with intelligence
   - Falls back to static responses when AI is disabled

## Next Steps for Production

### Phase 1: Complete LLM Integration
- [ ] Wire up `BehaviorModel` to actual LLM providers
- [ ] Implement prompt caching for performance
