## Section 4: Technical Approach

We're considering two approaches:

**Approach A: WASM SDKs**
- Write in Go, AssemblyScript, or Python
- Compile to WebAssembly
- Runs in secure sandbox
- Good performance (~2x Rust)
- Limited library access

**Approach B: Remote Plugins**
- Write in any language
- Runs as separate HTTP/gRPC service
- Full library access
- Slight network latency (1-50ms)
- Easier debugging

### Q10: Which approach appeals to you more?
- [ ] Approach A (WASM SDKs)
- [ ] Approach B (Remote Plugins)
- [ ] Both, for different use cases
- [ ] Neither/Not sure

**Please explain your reasoning:**
_______________________________________________________

### Q11: What latency is acceptable for your use cases?

**Authentication**: _____ ms
**Template functions**: _____ ms
**Response generation**: _____ ms
**Data source queries**: _____ ms

### Q12: How important are these factors? (1 = Not Important, 5 = Very Important)

| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Performance/Speed | 1  2  3  4  5 |
| Security/Isolation | 1  2  3  4  5 |
| Ease of Development | 1  2  3  4  5 |
| Library Access | 1  2  3  4  5 |
| Debugging Experience | 1  2  3  4  5 |
| Deployment Simplicity | 1  2  3  4  5 |

- [ ] Debugger integration
- [ ] Hot reload/fast iteration
- [ ] Unit testing framework
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Documentation/examples
- [ ] CLI tools
- [ ] Docker support
- [ ] Other: __________

### Q14: How important is backwards compatibility?
- [ ] Critical (plugins must never break)
- [ ] Important (willing to update occasionally)
- [ ] Moderate (acceptable for major versions)
- [ ] Not important (early adopter, expect changes)

### Q15: Would you prefer:
- [ ] Fewer languages with excellent support
- [ ] Many languages with basic support
- [ ] A mix of both (tiered support)
- [ ] No preference
