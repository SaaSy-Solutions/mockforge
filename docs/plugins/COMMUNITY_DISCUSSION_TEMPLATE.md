# üåê RFC: Polyglot Plugin Support for MockForge

## üì¢ We Need Your Feedback!

We're planning to add support for writing MockForge plugins in multiple programming languages beyond Rust. Before we invest significant development effort, we want to hear from **you** - the community!

## üéØ What We're Proposing

Currently, MockForge plugins must be written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. While this provides excellent security and performance, we've heard feedback that it creates barriers for many developers.

We're proposing **two complementary approaches** to enable plugin development in multiple languages:

### Approach 1: WASM SDKs for Multiple Languages

Write plugins that compile to WebAssembly using:
- **Go** (via TinyGo)
- **AssemblyScript** (TypeScript-like)
- **Python** (via Pyodide - experimental)

**Example (Go)**:
```go
package main

import "github.com/mockforge/sdk/go/mockforge"

type MyAuthPlugin struct{}

func (p *MyAuthPlugin) Authenticate(ctx *mockforge.PluginContext,
    creds *mockforge.AuthCredentials) (*mockforge.AuthResult, error) {

    // Your Go code here - use Go's standard library!
    if creds.Token == "valid-token" {
        return &mockforge.AuthResult{
            Authenticated: true,
            UserID: "user123",
            Claims: map[string]interface{}{"role": "admin"},
        }, nil
    }

    return &mockforge.AuthResult{Authenticated: false}, nil
}

func main() {
    mockforge.ExportAuthPlugin(&MyAuthPlugin{})
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Maintains WASM security sandbox
- ‚úÖ Good performance (Go ~2x Rust speed)
- ‚úÖ Tight integration with MockForge

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚ùå Still requires WASM toolchain
- ‚ùå Limited access to some libraries

### Approach 2: Remote Plugins (Any Language!)

Run plugins as standalone HTTP/gRPC services in **any language**:

**Example (Python)**:
```python
from mockforge_plugin import RemotePlugin, AuthResult

class MyAuthPlugin(RemotePlugin):
    async def authenticate(self, ctx, creds):
        # Use ANY Python library - pandas, numpy, requests, etc!
        import requests
        import jwt

        # Verify token with external service
        response = requests.post("https://auth.example.com/verify",
                                json={"token": creds.token})

        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            return AuthResult(
                authenticated=True,
                user_id=data["user_id"],
                claims=data["claims"]
            )

        return AuthResult(authenticated=False, user_id="")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    plugin = MyAuthPlugin()
    plugin.run(port=8080)
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Use **any** language (Python, Node.js, Ruby, Java, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Full access to language ecosystem
- ‚úÖ Native development tools
- ‚úÖ Easy debugging

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚ùå Network latency (~1-50ms overhead)
- ‚ùå Separate service to deploy
- ‚ùå Different security model
